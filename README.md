## Running the Resume Analysis System

To fully use the AI-powered resume analysis functionality, you need to run both the frontend application and the backend API server.

### Starting the Backend API Server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (first time only):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the API server:
   ```
   # On Windows:
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
   
   # On Linux/Mac:
   ./run_api.sh
   ```

   The server will run at http://localhost:8001 (note we're using port 8001 to avoid conflicts)

4. You can access the API documentation at http://localhost:8001/docs

### Starting the Frontend Application

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project root directory

2. Install the dependencies (first time only):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

### Testing the Resume Analysis

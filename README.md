TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection (corpus). It combines two metrics:

**Term Frequency (TF)** – Measures how often a word appears in a document.
**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** – Measures how rare or common a word is across all documents.

## Performance Metrics 📈

Our system demonstrates effective performance across key recruitment metrics:

### Processing Accuracy Metrics

The platform consistently delivers reliable document processing:

| Metric | Average Value | Description |

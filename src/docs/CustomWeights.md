# Using Custom Weights in Resume ATS Checker

The Resume ATS Checker allows you to customize how different aspects of a resume are weighted during analysis. This helps you tailor the matching algorithm to your specific job requirements.

## Accessing Weight Settings

1. Open the ATS Checker dialog by clicking the "ATS Checker" button in your folder view.
2. Look for the "Customize Scoring Weights" option below the job description field.
3. Click this option to expand the weight settings panel.

## Understanding Weight Categories

The system analyzes resumes across five key categories:

- **Skills Match (default: 40%)**: How well the candidate's skills match the job requirements
- **Experience Relevance (default: 30%)**: Relevance and depth of work experience
- **Achievements/Impact (default: 20%)**: Notable accomplishments and awards
- **Education and Certifications (default: 5%)**: Academic qualifications and educational background
- **Cultural Fit/Soft Skills (default: 5%)**: How well the candidate may fit with company culture

## Adjusting Weights

1. Use the sliders to adjust the importance of each category.
2. As you adjust one weight, the others will automatically rebalance to ensure the total remains 100%.
3. Click the "Reset" button to return to the default weight distribution.

## When to Customize Weights

Consider adjusting weights in these scenarios:

- **Technical Roles**: Increase the Skills weight for highly technical positions
- **Leadership Roles**: Boost Experience and Cultural Fit weights
- **Entry-Level Positions**: Emphasize Education and Skills over Experience
- **Creative Positions**: Consider increasing Achievements weight to focus on portfolio impact
